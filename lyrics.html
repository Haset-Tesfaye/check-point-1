                All my life, I've been carried by grace
                 Don't ask me how 'cause I can't explain
               It's nothing short of a miracle I'm here

               I've got some blessings that I don't deserve
                I've got some scars, but that's how you learn
                It's nothing short of a miracle I'm here

                I think it over and it doesn't add up
                I know it comes from above

                 I've got miracles on miracles
                A million little miracles
                Miracles on miracles
                Count your miracles
            One, two, three, four, I can't even count 'em all

              You held me steady so I wouldn't give up
                You opened doors that nobody could shut
          I hope I never get over what You've done

           I wanna live with an open heart
            </pre>
